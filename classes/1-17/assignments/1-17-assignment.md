1. Go to http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#hello-rails-bang
2. Start the turorial at 4 Hello Rails
3. Make logical commits along the way
  * Check out http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html for some tips about writting commit messages
  * You can probably get by with `git commit -am "Here is my message"` but checkout http://try.github.io/ if you are not familiar with git. 
4. That's it!  Kevin and I will be snooping in your repository on the due date.
